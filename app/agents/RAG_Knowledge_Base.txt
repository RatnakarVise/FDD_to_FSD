prompt: >
  Using ONLY payload data, especially Purpose, Scope, or Requirement Summary sections:
  1. Describe WHY this report/utility/program exists (purpose).
  2. Explain WHAT boundaries it covers (scope).
  3. Identify WHO the primary users/stakeholders are (audience).
  Combine only relevant points, avoid assumptions, and keep it concise and professional.
 
#Business Requirement Overview

prompt: >
  Summarize the business requirement based STRICTLY on payload content.
  Include:
  - What problem the business is facing
  - Why the solution/report is needed
  - Expected business outcome or impact
  Avoid technical or solution-level language. No assumptions.
 
#Business Process Flow
type: diagram
description: Process flow representation of the business scenario.
prompt: >
  Extract process steps ONLY from payload text. Convert them into a simple A -> B -> C style flow.
  Instructions:
  - If conditional steps exist, format as: StepA -> [Yes] StepB -> [No] StepC.
  - Avoid adding artificial steps like "Start", "End" unless they naturally fit.
  - Completely avoid diagrams, mermaid, bullets, or multi-line text.
 
#Functional Scope
type: text
description: What is in-scope and out-of-scope functionally.
prompt: >
  Based on payload content, clearly list:
  1. In-Scope items (all business or functional capabilities this solution will support).
  2. Out-of-Scope items (explicit exclusions or unsupported capabilities).
  If out-of-scope is not present, leave it blank—DO NOT assume.
  Provide structured numbered lists.

#Functional Solution Approach
type: text
description: How the solution fulfills the business requirement.
prompt: >
  Read the payload carefully and describe HOW each in-scope functionality will be delivered.
  Include:
  - Logical sequence of system operations
  - How user inputs drive the process
  - High-level validations or data lookups
  - How SAP objects (tables, logic, UI actions) are used
  DO NOT include code-level technicalities. Keep it functional, step-based, and accurate.
 
#Functional Requirements
type: table
description: Detailed functional requirements extracted from payload.
fields: [Requirement ID, Requirement Description, Business Rule, Priority, Comments]
prompt: >
  Analyze payload content and extract all functional requirements.
  For each requirement:
    - Provide a short, precise description.
    - Capture any rule or condition mentioned.
    - If priority is not provided, set [Medium].
    - Comments can remain [To Be Filled] unless content exists.
  DO NOT invent any new requirement.

#Field Logic
Type: Table
Purpose: Document and present all field names along with their corresponding business logic.
Prompt: >
Generate the Field Logic section for the functional specification. Create a two-column table with the headers Field Name and Field Logic.
- Consolidate all field logic entries. Explain from which table field needs to be fetched 
- Explain the on which conditions these fields needs to be fetched.
- Explain what all calculations needs to done.
- Remove any duplicate field names or logic entries.
- Ensure the records are sorted in the correct functional order.
- Display each field only once, with its associated logic clearly described.”
 
#Interfaces & Integration
type: table
description: Interfaces or external integrations involved.
fields: [Interface ID, Source System, Target System, Data/Message Type, Frequency/Mode, Description]
prompt: >
  Extract ONLY interfaces explicitly mentioned in the payload.
  If none exist, return an empty table structure.
  Do NOT assume or generate hypothetical integrations.
 
#Output
type: text
description: List of outputs generated by the report/utility.
prompt: >
  Identify all outputs mentioned in the payload:
  - ALV outputs, PDF/Excel exports, logs, summaries, status messages
  - File formats (if specified)
  - Output destinations (SAP GUI, Fiori, AL11, email, etc.)
  - Business purpose for each output
  If no output is present in payload, state: "No functional outputs specified."
 
#UI Requirement
type: table
description: Screen fields, selection logic, validations, and behaviors.
prompt: >
  From payload:
  1. Identify ALL UI fields (Selection screen, P_/S_ parameters, radiobuttons, checkboxes).
  2. Mention:
      - Field name
      - Field type (Input/Checkbox/Radio/Dropdown/Date)
      - Mandatory Yes/No
      - Default values (if any)
      - Validation rules tied to fields
  3. Describe any dynamic field behavior.
  4. Avoid assumptions—capture only what payload provides.
 
#Authorization & Security
type: table
description: Functional roles & authorization objects required.
fields: [Role/Profile, Authorization Object, Access Level, Description]
prompt: >
  Extract ONLY the security and authorization roles mentioned in payload.
  If none exist, create one row containing:
  Role/Profile = [To Be Filled], Authorization Object = [To Be Filled], Access Level = [To Be Filled], Description = [To Be Filled]

#Error Handling & Notifications
type: text
description: Error message behavior, exception handling, and validations.
prompt: >
  Based on payload:
  - List all functional validations
  - Describe error handling rules
  - Identify exceptions (e.g., ALV no-data, authorization failure, etc.)
  - Include user-facing message conditions only if present
  Use a numbered list and avoid assumptions.
 
#Assumptions & Dependencies
type: text
desciption: Document assumptions and dependencies.
prompt: >
  Extract all assumptions or dependencies from payload.
  If none exist, leave empty.
  DO NOT create assumptions on your own.
 
#Test Scenarios

fields: [Test Case ID, Objective, Input Data, Expected Output, Actual Result/Status, Sign-off/Comments]
prompt: >
  Convert payload-provided unit test plan or functional steps into structured test cases.
  If test case fields are missing, set them to [To Be Filled].
  DO NOT generate assumptions; use payload-driven steps only.
 
#Sign-Off
type: table
description: Sign-off sheet for all parties.
fields: [Role, Name, Signature, Date]
prompt: >
  Generate table with:
  - Prepared By
  - Approved By
